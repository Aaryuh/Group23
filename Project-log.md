## **Parts of the Game**

1. Board (+ Atoms)   
2. Cell (+Influence [?])   
3. Game (+ Logic + Rays)   
4. Board Display  

- The atoms and the board can be considered as a single unit or entity of the game.
- Insert the random generator to place the atoms in the board
- Cell will be a separate entity.
- Cells and the atom can be considered together…?
- Basic idea of the game will be the I/O.
- Board (collection of cells)- all 61 cells.
- Logic + Game (basically the main that calls all the rules/entities of this whole game)– both go hand in hand+ *Rays*
- Board display separate (to be considered at last).
- //Random allocation of the atoms//- game logic
- Show the hidden location of the atoms- for testing purposes


### <u>Tasks before next session</u>: 

- [ ] Clear the doubts 
- [ ] And decide on the rest of the sprints.

#### <u>Project plan</u>

<u>Sprint- 1</u>

- Implementation of the board - making the cell, then data structure to hold all the cells, making an atom, then randomly allocating them to the cells, then display.
- First we’ll try to implement using JavaFX.

<u>Sprint 1</u>
1. Implementation of the board
2. Random allocation of the atoms
3. Show the hidden location of the atoms
4. Display of the board with promised implementations


<u>Sprint- 2</u>
Implement the following Rays (Sending  + Logic )-

1. Encountering no atoms
2. Absorption of the ray

<u>Sprint-3</u>

1. $60^o$ deflection
2. $120^o$ deflection

<u>Sprint- 4</u>

1. $180^o$  reflection
2. Complex path
3. Scoring 
4. Display all features and scoring at the end of the game.

<u>Things to work on today</u>:
- [ ] High level design
- [ ] Better phrase the project plan

Date: **05/02/2024**

- Finalising the project plan and the high level design.
- Deciding on the which GUI application to use.
